          "A game of strategy and skill, chess is played the world over by young and old alike. To play, two opponents face off across a checkers-style board, and take turns using their pieces of kings, queens, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns to move along the 64-square board. Game times vary — great players can knock out their opponents very quickly or can spend hours strategizing their every move. To win, a player must use his pieces to capture those of the other player, with the ultimate goal of taking over the other player’s king. Checkmate! Often called “The Game of Kings,” you can play chess the good old-fashioned way with another player in person, or on the computer with opponents from all over the world.",

For all the troubles that they undoubtedly face every day, the folks in charge of maintaining building and code standards don’t get as much gratitude. Think about it; checking a building and approving it as secure according to code is not easy. Anything overlooked can endanger people living in an unsafe building. This is why it is important that we show our appreciation for them",

          "Cherry Popover Day is celebrated on September 1 every year. This day honors the delicious treat, the cherry popover, which is enjoyed and loved by many. But what exactly is a cherry popover? A cherry popover is a light and airy roll that is made from egg batter, topped with cherries, and baked in a pan. Popovers are said to be English-inspired. Settlers from Maine who founded Portland, Oregon created the popover by giving the English Yorkshire pudding an American spin. They can be consumed both as a sweet treat or as a proper breakfast or brunch meal.",

          "Ginger Cat Appreciation Day brings a little love to ginger cats. Sometimes called marmalade cats or tiger cats, ginger cats are orange tabby cats. Tabby cats have striped, marbled, ticked, or spotted markings on their coats, and almost always have a marking in the shape of an M on their forehead. All orange cats are tabbies, but not all tabbies are orange. There are no solid orange or ginger cats. Ginger cats come in shades of orange, gold, and red. Most ginger cats are male, and both domestic or wild cats can be ginger cats.While all ginger cats are honored today, one particular ginger cat, Doobert, is recognized today for his role in helping change animal transport. Chris Roy created a software platform that helps coordinate animal rescue relay transport, which is used by rescue organizations and volunteers, and named it after Doobert, his late ginger cat. Doobert is by no means the only ginger cat to have ever garnered a bit of attention. Milo of The Adventures of Milo and Otis fame, Garfield, Winston Churchill's cat, Jock, Jones from Alien, and Orangey, who starred in Breakfast at Tiffany's, among other films, all have had their time in the spotlight. But whether famous or not, all ginger cats are celebrated today!",

That's no problem today, though, because National No Rhyme or Reason Day is for creating rhymes that don't actually rhyme. English words that don't rhyme with any other words are known as refractory rhymes, and using them makes National No Rhyme or Reason Day quite easy to celebrate. While there may be some obscure words that rhyme with purple, toilet, and orange, there aren't many, and when words like these are used while forming rhymes today, the phrases likely won't have much rhyme or reason to them.",
